# Oil Be There For You

_Walkthrough, Difficulty [Medium](/)_

**Your client is XYZ Energy. They are concerned about declining profits and would like your help in diagnosing the problem.**

Sure. What exactly does the company do? What geography is it located in?

**The company is in the oil business in India. They extract and sell oil to third-party distributors.**

Got it. How much have profits declined by and since when has this been happening? Have profits gone down across
India or is the decline limited to a specific region?

**The profits have seen a decline of about 2-3%. This has been happening for the last 2 months. Profits have gone down in the Eastern region of the country.**

Have our competitors too seen a similar decline?

**No.**

Okay. Profits are equal to Revenues minus Costs. Has there been a change in revenue in the last 2 months?

**The revenues have remained stable.**

Sounds like the declining profits are driven by increasing costs then. I would like to draw the value chain of the company
and see which costs have seen an increase.

**Go ahead.**

Sure. The different steps of the value chain are as follows:

1. Licensing: Getting the requisite permissions to commence operations.
2. Exploration: Identification of prospective sites to extract oil and conducting studies to assess the sites.
3. Extraction: Setting up the drill and other machinery and extracting the oil. This stage also involves money spent on
   labour.
4. Transportation: Oil is usually transported in pipelines. Maybe this stage has seen an increase in repair costs, cost of
   setting up new pipelines, etc.
5. Refining: Converting the crude oil extracted into useable forms.
6. Storage: Money spent on tanks or reservoirs may have seen an increase.
7. Distribution: Distribution costs may have increased.

Do we know which stage of the value chain has seen an increase in costs?

**In fact, our extraction costs are higher than usual. Why do you think this may be the case?**

Interesting. We can further divide extraction costs into:

1. Cost of machinery (drills, motors, etc.)
2. Power
3. Labour
4. Restoration of site

Am I missing out on any costs at this stage?

**You have listed most of the relevant costs. The power used at this stage to run the machinery is unusually high.**

Okay. This could be due to the following reasons:

1. Old machinery: Due to wear and tear, our machinery may not be as efficient as before.
2. Terrain: Maybe the terrain is different and our drills have to expend more energy to extract oil.
3. Wastage: It is possible that power is getting wasted at some point such as transmission.
4. Deepness: More power may be expended to extract the oil if it is located deeper in the ground.

**Spot on. We had taken up a new project in Assam a couple of months ago. The terrain has been difficult to work on and our costs have seen an increase. What would you recommend?**

The following solutions can be explored:

1. Using manpower to loosen the terrain to make it easier for the machinery
2. Changing our machinery to ensure energy efficiency
3. Recovering the cost from the end-consumers

**Good. We can end the case here.**

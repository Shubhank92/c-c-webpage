# Soya Chip Case

_Walkthrough, Company [Bain Capability Network](/)_

**Interviewer :- A company HBL manufactures snacks and Beverages and is the market leader in India for soya chips, for the last 20 years . But recently, because of some local competition, Their volume share Fell from 60% to 20 % in a single year and this mainly happened in the east Indian market. Figure out a reason for the decline and what the company should do so as to sort of reverse that decline.**

Candidate :- Alright, I would like to ask a few questions first.

**Interviewer :- Sure, you can go ahead.**

Candidate :- Why is this a problem in the first place and what exactly, we're trying to solve.

**Interviewer :- It's a major problem because it's a huge decline that was unexpected. And so we want to capture the market share that we've lost.**

Candidate :- Have we only lost market share for, soya chips or for other snacks as well.

**Interviewer :- This only happened for soya chips.**

Candidate :- Is the drop only in volume or in terms of value as well .

**Interviewer :- The value had also Fallen.**

Candidate :- Okay. So I will begin with the manufacturers themselves, I wanted to ask about
the manufacturing facility, if they had made any changes in equipment , in staff or the location
of their factory in recent years, so is there any such change, in house within their factories.

**Interviewer :- There had been no such change.**

Candidate :- So could you tell me if the size and number of Distributors had stayed the same
or not over the years ? And their locations as well.

**Interviewer :- This is also not a problem.**

Candidate :- What about the retail end of the company. Are they using the same Retailers, and is the shelving still the same. And Did they recently decide to move from big box retailers to smaller retail stores or kirana stores ?

**Interviewer :- That there was no problem within the retail stores as well.**

Candidate :- Alright . So had the company changed anything about their marketing, in terms of advertising or the promotional tactics , They were using . Was the pricing similar from the competitors and consumer perception still the same ?

**Interviewer :- Yes, they have a similar pricing. That is not the issue.**

Candidate :- Could you tell me if there was an increase in the competitors or not ?

**Interviewer :- There's a competitor called ABC which started in the market Just this year, and they are the other ones who are performing very well. Apart from ABC, there are two other established competitors, which is AWT, which has a 10% market share and DBT, which Has a five % market share. Also,East India accounts for 10 percent of the national soya chip market. And so this was 120,000 tons of soya chips and with 60 percent market share that the company was selling. And the company overall had a forty percent share in India. So the majority of the companyâ€™s share came from East India.**

Candidate :- Alright , I think that the problem was happening through the competitors, but just to be able to identify all the areas and make sure,
Could you tell me something about our product itself. If the company had changed the product positioning, or if it had tried anything new.

**Interviewer :- No, nothing had been changed in the product.**

Candidate :- Could you tell me more about the customer preferences, and the new competitor - ABC.

**Interviewer :- ABC has a product called baked soya chips, and This is what's eating into most of the market share.**

Candidate :- So I think that the consumer perception has been changing . And there are more, health-conscious consumers who are moving away from fat products. So they're looking for healthier alternatives.
I think that there was no decline in production. And the problem is not supply driven.
The problem was also not retail and distributor driven and because all the competitors were also using sort of a similar value chain, so it was not an internal problem.
It was internally driven by external factors which were competitors and changing consumer preferences. So the main person the company had to beat was ABC and their baked soya chips . Yeah, so I think that was the problem.

**Interviewer :- Okay that sounds good. Now can you provide some solutions for the same & give your final recommendations. What sort of an approach can we give to the client for regaining their market share?**

Candidate :- Yeah. So I think the company needs to change the product and the positioning because nothing really had changed internally within HBL for a very long time.
It had stayed consistent so they had been very reactive to the market rather than being proactive.
So we can change the positioning , change our product and to start investing more into market research, and also to invest more within Innovation and R&D,
so This can be a short-term approach which involves to change the market positioning of their existing products , to regain some of their market share, and a long-term approach,
which involves to invest more in R&D and have better products in the future.

**Interviewer :- This sounds like a good plan. That would be all. We can end the case here.**

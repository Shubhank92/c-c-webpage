# Crumbling Biscuits Revenue

_Walkthrough, Company [Kearney](/)_

**Case Statement: A manufacturer for a biscuit producing company has approached you. His company’s revenue has been falling steadily for the past 2 months. He wants you to find out why and to remedy the problem.**

_Approach:_

Candidate: I’d like to ask some clarifying questions before I begin, is that okay?

**Interviewer: Sure, go ahead.**

Candidate: How many types of biscuits do you sell? Is it many types or just one single type?

**Interviewer: We only have one particular type of biscuit. A glucose biscuit which our company is known for.**

Candidate: Alright then. I’d like to know how exactly have your revenues have been falling?
Is it that your costs have gone up and profit margins shrinking?
Or is it that your total sales volume and thus revenue has been falling?

**Interviewer: So, it is our revenue as a whole that has been falling, as in 2 months ago our revenue was Rs. XX and right now it is Rs. YY which is an amount lower than XX.**

Candidate: Alright, so is the loss in revenue to do a reduction in the number of packets sold or have your prices per packet reduced?

**Interviewer: No, it is not either of the above.**

Candidate: Alright, how exactly do you manage the sales of your product?
Do you sell it directly through a website, through e-tailers like Amazon, Flipkart or through big box retailers like DMart and Big Bazaar?

**Interviewer: We have wholesale distributors to whom we sell our products as the intermediary. They then resell the product to the retailers and to websites.**

Candidate: Alright, so the falling revenues – are they from sales to the stores or sales to websites?

**Interviewer: Most of our falling revenue has been from stores and not the websites. In addition 80% of our revenues come from physical brick and mortar stores, so we’d like you to focus on them.**

Candidate: Where do the stores place your product? Have they changed locations recently which might have impacted sales?

**Interviewer: No, our product has had and still have the best and most prominent location in stores. This has not changed.**

Candidate: Alright, so has the number of units you supply to your distributor changed?

**Interviewer: Yes, the number of units we sell to our distributors have reduced over the past two months?**

Candidate: And has the amount of raw material you purchase reduced?

**Interviewer: It has not reduced.**

Candidate: Alright then, so the issue is most likely within manufacturing.

**Interviewer: Yes, that seems to be right. So could you please help us pinpoint the exact issue within the manufacturing process?**

Candidate: Alright, so the machines you use in manufacture, are they manual or electric?

**Interviewer: All of them are electric.**

Candidate: Okay, the machines – are they suffering from any sort of wear and tear or damage?

**Interviewer: You need not worry about that, all our machines are in perfect operating conditions. They’re also the highest end models available for their purpose.**

Candidate: Okay, is the power supply to equipment being interrupted? Are they running with full efficiency?

**Interviewer: We have been facing issues with the intermittency of our power connection. This is because of the heavy rainfall in Chennai.**

Candidate: Alright then, in that case you could set up electric diesel-powered generators and arrange power from external vendors as a backup.
Also setting up heavy duty power backup can help solve this issue.

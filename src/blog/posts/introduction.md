<!-- # Introduction -->

The **Case and Consultancy Club of St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous) Mumbai**, is immensely proud to present its first ever casebook!

Through this endeavor, we aim to provide a bird’s eye view to a plethora of cases which are usually asked in consulting interviews.
Along with this, several common frameworks have been incorporated which can be produced for solving cases.
To aid students’ preparation and to give them a general understanding of what case interviews actually constitute of,
we have added industry reports at the end of the casebook which will help the readers of the book to get an idea how the industry works, which will seep into their broader understanding of cases as well!
This book is a compilation of cases which have been sourced from students itself as a part of the Placement Process in 2021-22.
The cases are furnished here from a wide array of companies - **Kearney, Dalberg, Deloitte, Accenture** to name a few.

Taking this opportunity, we want to extend our gratitude to all the students for kindly providing inputs for the cases.
Their effort and patience is immense. Also, we would like to thank the Entrepreneurship and Skill Development Cell (E-Cell) for having our back and helping us catapult our distant dream into a reality. Many thanks to the E-cell associates for tirelessly putting effort and being the real pillars for this casebook to happen. While we have taken all efforts to keep the cases unique and diverse (we tried our best to keep it MECE!), we regret any resemblance and overlap. We would love our readers to provide us with their feedback as it can help the future editions of this casebook.

This casebook has been tailor made to cater to the needs of complete beginners. The book aims at helping undergraduate students understand the basic frameworks and structures of cases in order to ace case interviews conducted by renowned Consulting firms. The purpose of these frameworks is to give the readers an idea of the different methods of solving cases. A variety of cases with varying difficulty level has been provided below along with a few practice cases that can be solved along with a partner. Kindly note that there is no definite way or one right solution in case solving. During the interview, emphasis is laid on the way the candidate structures their thoughts and comes up with unique solutions. Thinking creatively and out of the box makes candidates stand out from their peers. All the following cases have been taken from candidates who have cracked their case interviews and landed their dream job.

We wish all the readers _All the Best_ for their future endeavors and would welcome any suggestions towards the casebook.

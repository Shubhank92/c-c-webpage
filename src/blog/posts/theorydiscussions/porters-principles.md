# Porter's 5 Principles

**Porter's 5 Forces** is a framework developed by Harvard professor Michael Porter in 1979. It was designed to assess how strong the competitive position of a firm is in the market. The theory is modeled around the assumption that there are 5 forces that determine how intense the competition in any given market is and how attractive entry is.

Porters 5 Forces are often used by analysts to determine whether entering or expanding into a new market is viable and worth it. The framework is also used to determine and understand how strong the organizationâ€™s strengths are in a market that it already operates in.

## The 5 Forces

**- Supplier Power**:
How easy it is for suppliers to dictate prices. This depends on the extent of demand, how many suppliers exist, how hard it is for new suppliers to set up a business, and a few similar factors.

**- Buyer Power**:
How easy it is for buyers to drive prices down. The fewer buyers there are, the easier it is for them to drive prices down, via the law of supply and demand.

**- Competitive Rivalry**:
Multiple firms offering the same type of product, with very little differentiation will drive down profitability and hence reduce market attractiveness.

**- New Entry Threat**:
It depends on how easy it is for new competition to enter the market. This is higher if the market has low threat via the other forces as it means the market is profitable and entry attractive. Patents, government regulation, retention of highly skilled employees, etc are all ways to offset this threat.
Arguably, _taxation policy, regulation, and trade policy_ make the government the sixth force.

## Things to Keep in Mind

Use this model for a market with at **least 3 competitors** or more. Avoid using the model for a single firm, it is designed to provide an analysis of an entire industry.
Consider the impact the government might have on the 5 forces.
Keep in mind the **maturity** of the industry. Younger, less developed markets tend to be turbulent and exhibit a lot of change.
Frequent **re-analysis** is essential to make sure your model fits in with existing market realities.

## The Case

In the **June 2010 issue of Financial Times**, an article applied the 5 Forces model to the general business environment in India.
It discovered that the new entry threat was fairly low, due to stringent government regulation, and general public distrust of foreign entrants.
This was in comparison to more developed economies in which the government took a more hands-off role and let market forces determine the business environment, meaning that market rivalry is the more important force in those economies.
Supplier power and buyer power are fairly low in India, with large, splintered cohorts of buyers and suppliers available, which reduce their collective bargaining power.
Substitution Threat is particularly high in India as IP laws are fairly lax and allow lower-cost suppliers to copy products and offer cheaper imitations leading to undercutting and substitution.

# MECE (Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive)

MECE is a principle used by management consulting firms to describe **a way of organizing information**. The MECE principle suggests that to understand and fix any large problem, you need to understand your options by sorting them into categories that are: Mutually Exclusive– Items can only fit into one category at a time and Collectively Exhaustive – All items can fit into one of the categories.

- Non-MECE segmentation (Hobbies and interests)
- MECE Segmentation and Planning
- MECE segmentation can be applied to any type of business or personal concern.

Some examples of mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive segmentation include grouping customers by:

- Defined age brackets where there is no category overlap
- Country of Birth, assuming no geographical overlap
- Highest level of education obtained
- Defined revenue brackets
- Number of employee brackets

## How to Use MECE in a Case Interview

Case interviews are typically structured around a hypothetical problem the interviewer will ask you how to solve.
Example: MECE in a Market Entry Case Interview

_“A Tech Corporation currently has three major revenue segments – smartphones, computers, and tablets. They are now looking into entering the TV market but want your help understanding which geographical market to enter into first. What would you recommend?”_

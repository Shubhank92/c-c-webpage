# 80 20 Rule

## What is the 80/20 rule?

Also known as the Pareto principle, it states that 80% of the outcome comes from just 20% of the total work put in. It is more of an aphorism than
a hard and fast scientific rule, but is used to identify the most productive assets of a company.
It is most commonly used to point out that 80% of a company's revenue is generated by just 20% of the customers.

## Why is it important?

Trying to replicate whatever the 20% is doing right can lead to huge and sometimes disproportionate rise in productivity.
Ex: Sales people by following the Six Sigma principles have seen huge increases in productivity.

## Common Fallacies

Just because 80% of the results come from 20% percent of the inputs, it doesn’t mean that the rest of the inputs aren’t useful.
Inputs and outputs represent different units, so the percentage of inputs and outputs does not need to equal 100%

# 3C 1P Approach

The 3C – 1P model defines the **first planning step** that companies need to take in order to understand their current situation and drive their product. The 3C1P model was proposed by _Kenichi Ohmae_, a renowned Japanese strategy guru.

It is a business model which focuses on three key factors i.e. 3C (Company, Competition and Customers). All these factors all together can lead to a sustainable competitive advantage. The strengths of this Business Model lies in its simplicity, practicality, and emphasis on efficiency to reduce wastage.

## Customer

The customers are the basis for any corporation according to Kenichi Ohmae. To arrive at a market size it is very important for companies to find out about their target customers:-

- What do they want?
- How do they choose?
- What are the quantitative segments?
- Ages, trends in customer’s willingness to pay.
- Purchasing power

## Competition

According to Kenichi Ohmae these strategies can be constructed by looking at possible differentiation in functions such as purchasing, design, engineering, operational capacity, sales and maintenance.
The companies must analyse:

- Their market share.
- Direct and indirect competition.
- No. of competitors in the market.
- Substitutes of their products.
- Benchmarking with products.

## Product

It is essential for organizations to check the performance of their own products and strive to make it more useful for the buyers.

- Know the nature of the product [what it does, how it’s used, why it’s useful ]
- Product’s life cycle [new vs obsolete]
- Identifying complementary and substitute goods

## Company

The internal capacity of a corporation needs to be looked at to enter the market. It's also crucial to take into account their man-power, capital expenditure, infrastructure, channels of distribution used, organizational structure, etc. At the intersection of these variables - Company’s strengths, a customer’s needs, competitor’s offering, and the product , lies an effective marketing strategy to gain a potential competitive advantage and build a lasting company.

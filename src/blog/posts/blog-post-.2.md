# Banking on You

_Walkthrough, Difficulty [Medium](/)_

**Your client is a commercial bank that has faced a 20% decline in revenues. You need to analyse why this is happening and recommend solutions accordingly.**

Got it. Where is our client located? Since when have we been facing this problem?

**Our client is based out of Mumbai and has been facing this problem for 2 years now.**

Interesting. Have other commercial banks been facing a similar decline?

**Some of the banks have been facing this problem and some have not.**

Understood. Is there a specific branch of the bank that has been facing this problem?

**We are facing this problem in all branches across major cities.**

Alright. Do we have any information on which revenue stream has been the most affected? From what I know, the
revenue streams are:

1. Interest on loans
2. Fees and Penalties
3. Interest on forex investments
4. Locker storage facilities
5. Ancillary services.

**You seem to have quite a bit of knowledge of this industry. You can look at interest on loans.**

Sure. Here, I would like to look at:

Interest on loans = Amount of loans given _ Interest Rate _ Percentage Collected

Under amount of loans, we can look at:

1. Availability to funds to lend (Supply-side) or
2. Limited demand for loans.

**Great. We have realised that we don't have enough money to give as loans because our deposits have gone down.**

    Amount deposited = Number people depositing * Amount deposited per person

**Good. You can look at the amount deposited per person.**

Here, do we have information on whether there is a particular customer segment that has not been depositing as much?
Perhaps, on the basis of gender, age, etc.?

**Yes Indeed. We have realised that people between the ages of 21 and 35 have reduced the amount they deposit.**

Interesting.

    Amount deposited = Amount earned * % deposited

It is unlikely that everyone in this age bracket has started earning less.

**Yes, correct. You can look at % deposited.**

% deposited can be affected by:

1. Alternate opportunities such as investments in securities
2. Policies (collaboration with companies, etc.). Example â€“ HDFC Bank may be preferred for salary accounts
3. Increased consumption expenditure resulting in lower savings

**You have reached the solution. People are now investing in mutual funds and SIPs more than they are depositing in banks.**

Interesting. Let's look at what we can do.

1. Implement a mutual fund and SIPs division in our bank
2. Have alternative investment options like gold, etc.
3. Look at targeting people of other age groups.

**Good suggestions. We can close the case now.**

**Interviewer (Case Statement): You are a legal and regulatory information company and you want to enter the legal publishing market. Now identify the market size for these legal books.**

Candidate: Okay, understood please give me a minute to collect my thoughts.

**Interviewer: Yes, Of Course, Go ahead.**

Candidate: First, I would like to clarify if we’re only looking into hard/ physical copies or the
digital/soft copies too?

**Interviewer: No, you just have to focus on just the hard copies.**

Candidate: Now assuming that each law book price is 700 Rps to 1000 Rps.

**Interviewer: Yes, perfect that is exactly the price. Please proceed.**

Candidate: Taking the population of India, I will divide them into urban and rural areas. Let’s say the demand is much higher in urban areas and that the demand in rural areas is almost negligible. I will take the age bracket of 20 to 60 years which will include students and professors and those who are practicing law will also fall in this bracket.

**Interviewer: Okay yes makes sense, continue.**

Candidate: Now I will divide them into income brackets of higher-income, upper-middle-class, lower-middle-class, and below the poverty line. Assuming that the middle and below poverty cannot afford a 700 to 1000 rupee book so we will be focusing on higher income and upper-middle class. Now another filter we can include would be higher education. In these two categories, people pursuing higher education will be interested in law books, taking an arbitrary assumption of 80% that goes for higher education in India.

**Interviewer: Yes, that is a valid assumption.**

Candidate: Now the main filter would be which stream is the person pursuing.
Science students would not need a law book and if you are a commerce (accounting/ CA) or art (Law students) student you will need a law book.
Taking an assumed percentage of how many students, therefore, would be needing it.

Candidate: The last thing we need to look at is how frequently a person would buy a law book.
Therefore assuming a student buys it once a year (based on personal experience) and a practicing lawyer would buy it twice a year.
Multiplying this with the price and adding the previously assumed numbers we would get the market of legal publishing books.

**Interviewer: Thank you, you thought it out logically, great job.**

# Olympic Resurgence

Walkthrough

<!-- _Walkthrough, Company [Kearney](/)_ -->

**Interviewer (Case Statement): You are made the sports minister of India; what do you think are the problems stopping India from getting at least 20 medals in the upcoming Olympics.**

Candidate: So as a former athlete/ lay person approaching this problem,
I’d start by attempting to solve the problems which had earlier affected me personally/ which I believe is an issue for athletes.

These are the significant issues most sports disciplines face in India:

1. Cricket seems to overshadow all other sports, which seems to kill the drive in a lot of young athletes to pick up any other sport due to a lack of visibility and resources.

2. A lot of untapped talent inside India’s rural regions go ignored because of a lack of funds invested in outreach/ training.

3. Corruption/ a lack of transparency during the selections process, which leads to a lot of talented athletes being ignored or passed over.

Addressing these issues are vital to ensure that India gets at least 20 medals in the next Olympics.

**Interviewer: Are you sure you did not forget anything?**

Candidate: Oh? Please give me a minute to just rethink everything.

**Sure, Go ahead.**

Candidate: Oh! I forgot about the space where no employees would be there, i.e, hallways, stairs, lifts etc.

**Interviewer: Yes! Very good.**

Candidate: So let’s say that the space, 40% would be not used and 60% would be the office space of the employees. Then the added 40% would give us a total of Rps. 12,80,00,000.

**Interviewer: Yes, that seems logical, Good job.**

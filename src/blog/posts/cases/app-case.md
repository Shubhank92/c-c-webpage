# App Case

Walkthrough

<!-- _Company [Bain Capability Network](/)_ -->

**Interviewer (Case Statement): You, being a founder of an app, need 1 lakh students in 1 year. What will be the relevant revenue streams and how will you be reaching this target of achieving one Lakh students?**

Candidate: Please give me a minute to gather my thoughts.

**Interviewer: Yes, sure.**

Candidate: I have a few questions I would like to ask first. What does the app do?

**Interviewer: So the app is for making a community of changemakers of society.**

Candidate: What was the foundation cost?

**Interviewer: The foundation cost is negligible.**

Candidate: How does the app exactly work?

**Interviewer: The app functions as a linked in for social workers/ changemakers. So firstly you download the app, and when one does any sort of social work then they upload that on this app. Now several people will be doing it at the same time.**

Candidate: Okay, but what makes our app so special?

**Interviewer: Each day the founders of the app will be identifying ten unique individuals who had considerable work/impact and give them a bronze medal on the platform. This medal would entail certain cash prizes such as 1000 rupees and some coupons and vouchers. When you get 10 bronze medals you will get a silver medal. This silver medal will entail 5000 rupees and more coupons and recognition. 10 of these silver medals will give 1 gold medal. The gold medal will give a cash prize of 10k to 20k and 10 such medals will give you a platinum medal. It keeps on getting upgraded.**

Candidate: Okay, so in this way we would be gamifying the whole process and making it a competitive sphere for social work, where we are also incentivizing people to post about their work.

**Interviewer: Yes, you have understood the concept now.**

Candidate: Also assuming that our cost can be divided into 2 types:

- fixed cost
- variable cost.
  The fixed cost will have the server and website and the variable cost will contain operations, maintenance, and serving people.

**Interviewer: Yes, you can continue.**

Candidate: First I will be focussing on the target of reaching 1 lakh students.
According to me we can have campus ambassadors, students from NSS, Girl Up/ enactors. Another path we can pursue would be social media influencers. Here we will be giving non-monetary and
monetary incentives.

**Interviewer: Okay, this makes sense. What will be the various revenue streams that you would look into?**

Candidate: A few that straight come to my mind are sponsorships, a sustainable business, donations, pro-bono activities, overtake social activities, etc.
Interviewer: That all is okay, but I don’t find anything unique in this. Try thinking out of the box.

Candidate: Maybe we can tap a rural market with this and since we have direct communication with them we can contact companies that would like to display their ads on this app. We could help farmers explore their business opportunities.

**Interviewer: How exactly would you get farmers involved?**

Candidate: We would help by being the connecting link to companies and weekly markets, by buying their produce from them at fair prices. We could also promote rural tourism.

**Interviewer: Give me an example of such rural tourism.**

Candidate: Many people like to come to Dharavi to understand how people live in slums, similarly we can invite schools and colleges, to show the young leaders of tomorrow how things happen at the ground level.

**Interviewer: Okay great. You’ve solved it well, good job indeed!**

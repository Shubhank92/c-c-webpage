# Number Of Coins

<!-- _Walkthrough, Company [Kearney](/)_ -->

Walkthrough

**Interviewer: Guess and estimate the number of coins in a mall and remember we need to be time conscious.**

Candidate: Okay, so I'll take a mall that has 2 floors and a basement, will that work?

**Interviewer: Yes, it’s great, go ahead with it.**

Candidate: Okay so let’s assume that the Basement is used as a parking lot, the Ground Floor will have a supermarket and a few shops and the first floor will have restaurants.

**Interviewer: Are you sure you’re not forgetting something?**

Candidate: I am? Oh yes! A food court on the 1st floor too, yes got it.

**Interviewer: Okay, good. Please proceed.**

Candidate: Okay so I'll make the structure now

Yes so, let’s first look at the Ground Floor. It has a supermarket and coins will be with customers and check-out counters. In an area of 100 sq.ft, there’ll be 10 customers and 1 staff member.
The average area of a supermarket is 20,000 sq.ft, and 20% will be used as storage, so therefore 16,000 sq.ft will be functional.

So, there will be 1600 people.

- (calculation: 16000/ 1000 x 10= 1600)
- The staff would be 170
- (calculation: 160+10(behind the counter)= 170)
  The number of cash counters would be 10 and 2 counters for card-holders and each counter, suppose has 50 coins, therefore 500 coins (50 x 10). Is this okay?

**Interviewer: Yes, you’re going in the right direction, do continue.**

Candidate: Say there are 20 shops, 10 clothes shops and 10 miscellaneous.
Let each clothes shop's capacity be 20 people and 5 staff members and each of them has 1 counter, so then we get 500 coins in the clothes shop.

- (calculation: 10 x 50= 500)

Now when it comes to miscellaneous shops, is it okay to assume that the number of coins is negligible,
since they are different shops and there’s no way to assume for any of them.

**Interviewer: Yes, it seems logical enough to assume that.**

Candidate: Great, so now we know that the clothes shop capacity is 20 people and 5 staff and the capacity for Miscellaneous shops is 20, but let’s assume they are at 60% capacity, so therefore 12 customers and 2 staff members.

Hence, the number of customers in the shops should be 320.

- (calculation: 20 x 10 = 12 x 10= 320)
- And the number of staff would be 70.
- (Calculation: 5 x 10 + 2 x 10+ 70)
  Therefore the total number of customers would be 2000(320+1600= 1920, round it off for calculation purposes) And the total staff would be 250 (70+170=240, 240+10(ancillary staff)= 250).

Now let’s look at the First floor, where the food court and restaurants are there.
I’ll assume that there are around 100 seats in the food court and it is working at 80% capacity, so therefore 80 seats/ 80 people are present there.
The number of restaurants, say, are 10 with 5 staff members in each so therefore, the total number of staff in the restaurant would be 50.
Now, looking at our assumptions, the total number of customers should be 2200.

- (calculations: 80+2000+100(for transit)= 2200)
  Out of the 2200, let 20% be bachelors,i.e, 440 people and 80% be family,i.e, 1600.
  Let each family size be 4, so therefore 1600/4(1 person carries money) gives us 400.

Therefore the total number of customers with money would be 840 and 40% would pay via online transactions or cars, so the number of customers with cash would be 500.
Let's say that each customer carries 5 coins, therefore the total would be 5 x 500= 2500 coins.

The staff would be carrying around 1750 coins.

- Calculations: 50+250
- =300 + 50 (ancillary basement + food court)
- =350 x 5
- =1750 coins

Now looking at the basement, since 50% of the customers who come with family have a car in the basement, that is 200 cars.

Let each car have an average of 3 coins, which will give us 600 coins. The basement, say, has 4 parking check-out booths, and each booth has 50 coins, so we get 200 coins.

Now the end calculation of the total number of coins would be:
200+600+1750+2500+500= 5600 coins.

Therefore, a mall has an estimated amount of 5600 coins. Is that okay?

**Interviewer: Yes! Very well done. Good job.**

# Water Powder Case

Walkthrough

<!-- _Walkthrough, Company [Bain Capability Network](/)_ -->

**Interviewer :- ( Case Statement ) A leading global consumer goods company has produced a new product for cleaning water to make it fit for drinking. The product is a sachet, which contains a powder. The powder is poured into a bucket of water and stirred for 20 minutes. At the end of the process, the silt/dirt that was in the water will settle at the bottom of the bucket and the bacteria in the water will have been cleaned/neutralized. On pouring, the recipient gets world health organization certified drinking water. The company has launched this product with varying rates of success in many developing countries and now they want to enter India. The company already sells other products in India. The CEO wants to know if they should enter the Indian market with this new product and if so, how? Structure your analysis of this problem.**

Candidate :- Alright, I want to begin by understanding if there are examples of other developing countries where this product has been launched , which can be taken into consideration while finding the break-even point.

**Interviewer :- Yes the product has worked efficiently in Brazil and Africa.**

Candidate :- Can you tell me something about the manufacturing cost of the product.

**Interviewer :- You can assume the numbers, the sachet can be sold at 1.2 $ per sachet. You can even assume that they can have a profit of 50 % on the cost price.**

Candidate :- I think we cannot assume such a high profit in an Indian market .This is because the labour cost here is slightly higher than other under-developed countries like Brazil or Africa where this product has already worked.
I will first focus on penetration of the product in the Indian market. For penetration we need launching of the product and then considering variable and fixed costs.
Can I assume that this will cost the company around $1billion?

**Interviewer :- Yes , you can go ahead with that assumption.**

Candidate :- Now I will focus on sales that will help the company to break – even .
Assuming that the product will be launched and focus only in rural areas , because in general urban cities and towns do not require a water purifying system per say, because they mostly get good and clean water and they have access to Aquaguards as well.
Considering the entire Indian population which is 138 crores , as of 2020 , around 60 % is rural and 40% is urban.
I am assuming that this company would want to focus only on rural areas.
Now in order to create an impact, it will take around 3-6 months .
This is because the rural mindset in general is that unless they see it , they don’t believe it.
So they have to see clear-cut benefits .

To break even at a price of $1.2 , the company will have to sell = $1b/$1.2= 83,33,33,333 sachets.

Assuming that the profit per sachet is 0.2 $ it would take 6 months for the company to start making this profit.

**Interviewer :- Sure , that is a fair assumption**

Candidate :- And yes, since the costs will break even and there is a scope for a profit margin, this company should launch the product in India.

**Interviewer :- This was an interesting analysis and approach. We can end the case.**

**Interviewer: You are thinking of starting a sports coaching center in Mumbai. You have to find a way to set the price of individual subscriptions for memberships at your coaching center. How will you do this?**

Candidate: Okay, firstly, am I establishing the coaching center for all sports or any particular sport?

**Interviewer: You’re establishing this center for coaching exclusively in handball.**

Candidate: Alright, so am I establishing this in any particular location in Mumbai? I have to know this as my pricing strategy will have to vary depending on the location.

**Interviewer: We can take the location to be in South Bombay, near the Fort locality.**

Candidate: Thank you, that’s all the preliminary information I’ll be needing.

Candidate: So, I’d begin by trying to estimate the number of schools and colleges within a 1-2km radius of the location of my center. In addition, I’ll be creating age brackets for coaching, such as under 12, under 14 etc.

Candidate: Using this information, I’ll estimate the number of potential students who’ll be able to sign up for my classes before I attempt to set a price.

Candidate: In addition, I’ll consider the availability of sports equipment in that locality. If it isn’t easily available for purchase, I’ll have to provide the equipment thus increasing the costs which will affect the price I have to set. Or if there are sufficient stores, I might be able to tie up with them to sell equipment to my potential students. If I can do this, the potential of being able to earn a commission on those sales can help offset the cost of the subscription.

Candidate: The last factor I’m taking into consideration is marketing. If I’m able to market the sport – handball, well enough, I’ll have next to no competitors as the sport is fairly niche and unheard of and as such, I’ll have complete dominance of the market since there aren’t many institutes that teach handball and as such, they’ll have to come to my institute to learn.

Candidate: Using these factors I can try and guesstimate the number of students I can expect and then try and set a price. Shall I go ahead?

**Interviewer: Actually no, your approach and factors are enough. We don’t need to go into the specifics. Thank you**

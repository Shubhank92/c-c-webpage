# Bifurcated State

Walkthrough

<!-- _, Company [Kearney](/)_ -->

**A state in India has been bifurcated. Calculate the space and cost space of the office of the secretariat.**

Okay, got it. Please give me a minute to gather my thoughts.

**Of Course, but try to wrap it up fast as we don’t have the whole day**

Now I have a few questions, first, how is this calculated and in what proportion were the states divided in?

**Okay this is common sense, the cost of space would be directly proportionate to the amount of space. The states have been divided in the ratio 2:1. Now try thinking of a building, how would the space be divided?**

Okay so that could be divided on the basis of religion/ culture, Revenue per state or the people/ settlements in each state.

**Hmm, Okay so not exactly, it was divided on the proportion of population per state.**

Ah okay, Let’s then say that there are 3 lakh people in total, and based on the ratio, state 1 gets 2 lakh people and state 2 gets 1 lakh people. So in the secretariat’s office of state 1, say there are 20,000 employees for 2 lakh people. Do we have any information on the employees?

**Yes your assumption is on the right track. Okay we have 4 types of employees.**

- **Type 1: take up 100 sq ft ; 10%**

- **Type 2 and 3: take up 150 sq ft each; 40% each**

- **Type 4: take up 300 sq ft; 10%**

Oh okay then on the basis of that the office space used would be:

=Type 1 + Type 2&3 + Type 4

=2000 x 100 + 16,000 x 150 + 2000 x 300

=2,00,000 + 24,00,000 + 6,00,000

=32,00,000 sq ft

=32L sq ft x 100/40

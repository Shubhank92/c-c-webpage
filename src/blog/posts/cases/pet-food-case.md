**Interviewer (Case Statement):- A private equity fund wants to invest in a pet food company which has been operating in India since the last three or four years. They require funds to be able to expand further into the market. Analyze and estimate the pet food market in India.**

Speaker :- Sure. I would like to begin by understanding about the products that the company offers right now.

**Interviewer :- The market has been served by global products so far and there has been less customization for cats and dogs within India. The products that the company offers right now includes three units:**

- **1.5kg units for Rs 500**
- **2.10 kg units for Rs 800**
- **3. 20 kg units for Rs 1500**
  **Overlooking the covid impact, calculate the market size either in terms of volume or value.**

Speaker :- So could you tell me about the kind of pets they offer products for and what has worked for them in the last 3 Or 4 years?

**Interviewer :- The company offers its product only for cats and dogs. And it caters to the local culture and it's customized according to the client's preferences.**

Speaker :- Are they manufacturers or just distributors?

**Interviewer :- They manufacture these products themselves.**

Speaker :- I would like to begin by estimating how much of the population would be pet owners and non pet owners. Should I look only at the consumer angle of it or a B2B?

**Interviewer:- Good Question. What do you think would be a good B2B angle to it?**

Speaker :- I think it would be pet shelters or vets.

**Interviewer :- Can you think of certain more innovative B2B applications for pet food?**

Speaker :- We could have pet cafes, which have also become really popular in urban areas

**Interviewer :- That sounds interesting. You can estimate both the B2B as well as the B2C angle of it.**

Speaker :- Sure. So the population of India is about 1.2 billion and generally it's like one pet per family.
Considering that an average family has 4 members , there would be around 300 million families within India.
And assuming that about 60 million of them would not have any pets whatsoever because either they are scared of pets or because they prefer not to have one.
As per my personal observation, I see that at least 20% of them, which is one in five people, cannot have pets because they're extremely scared of pets.
So the remaining 240,000,000 would be the population that is likely to have pets in the first place.

And then after that, I would like to take a 70-30 split for rural and urban India.
I will consider here families with kids and families without kids, because I think having kids would impact their decision of whether they want a pet as well as the kids might ask for them. Now this gives us the population of Rural India to be around 168 Million and 72 Million for Urban Areas.
Now, in the Rural Areas , around 90% of the families have kids, because they prefer to live in families, which is around 153 Million and the remaining 15 Million (10%) don’t have Kids.
In the Urban Areas, 60% families ( 42 Million ) have kids and 40% don’t (28 Million ).

Now, I have assumed that out of a population of 153 Million families in Rural areas who have kids, only 20 % ( 30 Million ) will be of such income level that they will be able to afford Pets and Pet food as well. This can be further divided into types of pets. Since Cats and Dogs tend to be the most Popular Pets, this would constitute around 50 % which is equal to 15 Million and the remaining 50 % would be for other pets.

Similarly in the Urban Areas , out of the total 42 Million Families with kids, only 20 % will be able to afford kids as well as pets. So this gives us 8.4 Million. Out of this, we can say that 50% will have cats and dogs which gives us 4.2 Million.

Now, Out of 28 Million Families in Urban Areas without Kids, 90 % of the families who don’t have kids won’t have pets and the remaining 10% will have pets, as they can afford as well, Which gives us around 3 Million . Out of this, 50% will have cats and dogs which is 1.5 Million and the remaining includes other pets.

Adding all of these, we get ( 15 + 4.2 +1.5 ) Million = 21 Million. So their annual sales in B2C market can be around 21 Million

Should I now focus on the B2B Market ?

**Interviewer :- The Figure for B2C Market Sounds good. Let’s end the case here.**

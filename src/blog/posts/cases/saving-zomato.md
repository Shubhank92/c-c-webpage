**Interviewer:- You’re a consultant hired by the CEO of Zomato. They’ve approached you to reduce their delivery costs. How would you go about doing this?**

Alright, so from what I’ve seen so far, Zomato delivery partners mostly use bikes for deliveries, at least within my locality.

An easy way to cut costs would be to switch to using bicycles instead of motorbikes at least for shorter distances. This means the long-term variable cost on fuel that bikes incur could be eliminated leaving only the immediate fixed cost of buying the bicycle. In addition, bicycles are more eco-friendly due to the lack of their emissions from burning carbon-based fossil fuels.

Another way of reducing costs is to bundle end users who live close together into basket. This means that instead of travelling back and forth from their homes to the restaurants, collecting and delivering orders individually – Zomato partner drivers could instead wait until a certain number of orders have been placed by user within a certain basket, collect all orders from within that basket and then deliver those orders simultaneously.

The above approach could cut down on the amount of fuel used, and the number of delivery personnel required to make these deliveries in addition to increasing efficiency at the cost of slightly increasing delivery times.

I’d like to know if using public transport is a valid approach to this problem?

**Interviewer:- Yes, you may use public transport as an approach to solve this problem.**

Alright. I feel like using public transport such as buses and local trains are an excellent way of cutting delivery costs for larger distances more than 10km. Distances shorter than that are unviable as the time cost of waiting for the bus/ train and commuting back and forth from the station will outweigh any savings.

Using public transport can reduce both the time and cost involved in making deliveries especially during the rush hour. Not to mention the reduction in pollution/ the eco-savings, making this both a financially and environmentally responsible choice in addition to having the potential to improve end user experience via reducing wait times

**Interviewer:- So do you have any more recommendations?**

Not really, I feel like implementing these steps should be more than enough

**Alright, we’re done then. Thank you for your approach**

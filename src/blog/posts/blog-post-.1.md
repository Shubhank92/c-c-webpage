**The year is 2021. Your client is a toy manufacturer and has been facing a decline in revenue in the past 1 year. You need to analyse why this is happening.**

Sure, I will begin by understanding the company better. What kind of a toy manufacturer are we? Where exactly do we
lie in the value chain and where exactly are we located?

**The client manufactures and supplies board games such as Monopoly, Ludo, etc. to third party distributors. The client is based out of Delhi.**

Alright, do we know the magnitude of decline? Have other board game manufacturers been facing a similar decline in
revenues as well?

**No, we do not have the exact numbers in this case. Other manufacturers have been facing a similar decline.**

Sure, It seems like an industry-wide problem to me then.
Given that we have a huge collection of board games, do we have information on which of these games have
experienced a decline?

**Good question, our revenue from Ludo has been affected the most.**

Thank you, we can begin by analysing the revenue from sale of Ludo boards.

Revenues can be affected by: 1) Supply-side issues 2) Demand-side issues
Do we have information on what might be causing the problem?

**The industryâ€™s supply side has not seen any change in the past 1 year.**

Alright, then it is fair for us to believe that the overall demand has plummeted.
Demand can be affected by four factors:

1. Product
2. Price
3. Place
4. Promotion

Under Product, we can look at:

1. Internal - Quality of the boards games offered, exterior looks of the game
2. External -
   1. Substitutes - People now prefer some other board game or people are playing this game on some other platform
   2. Complementary - It does not have the rule booklet/dice/player sticks anymore

Under Price, we can look at:

1. Increase in price by the industry players
2. Previously available discounts not applicable anymore

Under Place, we can look at:

1. The mode of distribution: Online or Offline

Under Promotion, we can look at:

1. Any negative publicity that this industry has received
2. Any excessive promotions undertaken by substitutes

**You have correctly identified it. Due to the lockdown on account of Covid-19, more people started playing on online apps because of which fewer people are buying board games.**

Yes this makes sense, I might be guilty of it myself.

**What do you think the client should do?**

The client can:

1. Prioritise promotion of other games
2. Collaborate with restaurants and cafes in the future to organize games and have prizes for winners
3. Organise events and game nights
4. Launching our own application and recovering some of the lost revenue through in-app purchases and
   advertisements

**Thank you, we can close the case now.**

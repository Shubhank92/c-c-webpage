**Interviewer: You are a consultant hired by a company that is a boiler manufacturer. They have been recently facing problems, their profits are declining. Identify the reason for this situation and come up with solutions to rectify this problem.**

Candidate: Alright, got it. Please give me a minute to jot down my thoughts.

**Interviewer: Of course.**

Candidate: Okay since this is a profitability case, I have a few clarifying questions I would like
to ask.

**Interviewer: Yes sure, go ahead.**

Candidate: So firstly, how long has this problem been going on?

**Interviewer: It has been almost 4 years.**

Candidate: And where does the company perform its service? And what exactly is the
company’s value chain?

**Interviewer: The company has various locations pan-india. Like any other boiler company, they buy their raw materials, produce the goods, and do maintenance after sale.**

Candidate: Okay, are we facing any problems with our competitors or customers?

**Interviewer: No, we are not facing any problems with them.**

Candidate: According to the information you have given, we are not facing any problems with our competitors or our customers or the value Chain and since this problem has been going on for around 4 years it only means that this must be an industry-wide phenomena, as any rational company would have immediately tried to rectify the problem.

**Interviewer: You are right it is an industry wide phenomena. The Company has been facing problems in all their locations Pan India. Their main customer base are steel companies; they just make a component that helps the manufacturers make steel.**

Candidate: Okay, got it. Please give me a minute to make my basic structure.

I have divided the profits into revenue and cost. Since you mentioned that we are not facing
any problems from our customers, that means our revenue has somewhat been the same but
since it is an industry-wide phenomena it must be something to do with the cost of production.
Now I have divided the cost into two different parts, that is fixed cost and variable cost. Is that
okay?

**Interviewer: Yes, very good, please continue.**

Candidate: Now in the fixed cost we have equipment, land, finance and variable cost we have fuel/power, raw materials, transport, employees and storage, could you please elaborate where exactly we are facing problems in this?

**Interviewer: According to data that we have gathered, the cost of raw materials has significantly gone up.**

Candidate: Okay then, can I assume that some of the raw materials being used are steel
sheets, pumps, pipes and Burners, by any chance do we import any of these?

**Interviewer: Pumps and bonus are imported whereas the steel and pipes are indigenously produced**

Candidate: It's safe to assume that the cost of imported material would have increased. Could you please elaborate more on that?

**Interviewer: Yes, so after a bit of digging into it we have realized that the number of components has not increased but the cost per component has increased.**

Candidate: Okay, there can be a few reasons why this increase has taken place, according to
me it can either be because of demand or operational efficiency or any regulatory changes
that have taken place.

**Interviewer: When it comes to operational efficiency there are two components that run this that are oil and coal. The usage of oil has increased from 30 ton to 50 ton and the usage of coal has decreased from 70 To 50.**

Candidate: Okay, could this by any chance have happened due to the increased regulatory restrictions to keep a check on the harmful effects of the emissions released?

**Interviewer: Yes, Very good.**

Candidate: So from all the information that you have given me I think the reason for the
industry-wide dip in profits is due to the rise in cost of the product. That comes from the
decrease in usage of coal and increase in the usage of oil.

**Interviewer: Yes you have got that right. So now as a consultant what could you do about this**

Candidate: Okay so after some thought, I’ve come up with 5 solutions:

We can pump up our revenue by increasing the prices

We could look into the variable costs and try to cut as much as we can

Expand our geographical reach and move out of India into other markets

We could also expand our customer base since we are only selling to Steel manufacturers
right now, so as to increase our demand.

Another thing that we could do is reach out to our customers that are the Steel
manufacturers and see where else they could use these boilers in order to increase the
demand for the same.

**Interviewer: That's great! I suppose this is it.**

# Profitability Case
A typical profitability problem would look like “Your profits are down by 10%, analyse the reason for the same.”
The problem here could stem from the revenue side or the cost side, or sometimes even both. 

The revenue side can be broken down into the number of units sold, and the price per unit. Sales could be affected by production, distribution, or demand. These factors must be analysed individually.
- Production can be analysed by looking at variables such as manufacturing units, capacity of each unit, capacity actually being used, manufacturing defects, etc etc
- Distribution can be analysed by studying variables such as the mode of distribution, number of distributors, amount sold per distributor, etc etc
- Demand can be analysed by figuring out whether all revenue streams have been affected equally
Cost side profitability problems are more diverse due to the sheer number of different costs involved. However, most costs can be categorized as fixed or variable in order to proceed further with only two distinct sources of reduced profitability.
- Variable costs vary directly with the level of production, such as wages, raw materials, transportation, etc.
- Fixed costs need to be paid regardless of the level of production, such as rent, interest, insurance payments, etc.

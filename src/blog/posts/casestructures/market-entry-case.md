A market entry case involves a client wanting to expand its offerings either geographically, or venturing into a new line of business.
Before proceeding with such a case, information regarding the existing geographies the client operates in, whether they have expanded into such markets previously, and within what time frame they want to achieve these goals in.

A good starting point to solve a market entry case would be to analyse the financial attractiveness, operational feasibility, and risks involved with choosing to enter the market.
Analysing the financial attractiveness normally involves analysing the expected profits, growth rate of the market, and the competitive landscape.
Estimating the expected profits normally involve estimating the market size, and hence, these cases typically include a guesstimate in them.
Analysing the operational feasibility can be done by looking at the client’s current operating model and considering any possible changes that might be required to implement specific to the market the client wants to enter into.

The risks involved with entering the market can be studied by applying models such as a PESTEL analysis, or examining the environment by using Porter’s 5 Forces.
These metrics should provide a general evaluation of whether the market is attractive enough for the client to venture into it or not.
